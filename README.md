Known issues
------------

With plans that include bonus minutes only the normal (non-bonus) minutes are shown. Normal minutes are only used after the bonus minutes are depleted. As far as I can tell usage of these initial bonus minutes is not reported anywhere on the Telus website.

Since the author of this program doesn't have access to all types of Telus Mobility accounts the widget may not work in some cases. If the data from the website is not recognized you will be given the option to review and securely send a copy of your account data to the author for review. You can also contact the author alexandre.jasmin@gmail.com or [report an issue][3] on github.
